You should compile the file "setup.ml" in this directory before trying
to load any of the source files; after that, the commands "load",
"showlib" etc. can be used to access the files without the need for a
directory pathname. For example,

    load Functions.ML       (* compiles the "Functions" file *)
    showlib Hal.ML          (* displays the "Hal" file in the editor *)

and so on.
