This directory contains the portable implementation of the 
Edinburgh Standard ML Library.

It has been tested with Standard ML of New Jersey 0.66,
Poly/ML 1.86, and Poplog ML 2.0  There are slightly more
efficient implementations for use with each of these systems.

See the documentation for installation details and a user
guide.
