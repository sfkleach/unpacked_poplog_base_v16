Revision 1.4  91/02/12  18:14:50  18:14:50  db (Dave Berry)
The GENERAL_TYPES signature now includes the infix functions defined in
General.sml, so this entry makes them infix at top-level.

Revision 1.3  91/01/30  19:01:18  19:01:18  db (Dave Berry)
Renamed loadFun and loadStr to loadEntry.

Revision 1.2  91/01/25  20:17:14  20:17:14  db (Dave Berry)
Changed signature names to all upper case.
Amended tag declarations to match above change.
