Revision 1.5  91/02/11  21:26:01  21:26:01  db (Dave Berry)
Now uses the pervasive implementations of streams.  I now believe that
any problems with end_of_stream on interactive streams, or error
messages, are the responsibility of the compiler writer.

Revision 1.4  91/02/04  16:57:43  16:57:43  db (Dave Berry)
This signature now defines all the pervasives on outstreams.  So an
implementation of this signature can replace the pervasives if necessary.

Revision 1.3  91/01/30  19:01:25  19:01:25  db (Dave Berry)
Renamed loadFun and loadStr to loadEntry.

Revision 1.2  91/01/25  20:19:22  20:19:22  db (Dave Berry)
Changed signature names to all upper case.
Amended tag declarations to match above change.
