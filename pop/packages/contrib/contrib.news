CONTRIB NEWS


All additions to "contrib" directories in Poplog should be announced in
this file, latest first. All contributions should normally be in a
sub-directory, where each sub-directory contains a README file listing
the contents and summarising their function. For the more complex
packages it may be appropriate to provide further subdivision into
different directories, e.g. doc, src, com, teach, etc., along with a
single program file that can be run in order to add the directories to
appropriate search lists.


1994
====
Nov 23 (Robert Duncan)
    --- ML-Lex (a lexical analyser generator) and ML-Yacc (an LALR
        parser generator) have been installed in $popcontrib/pml.

1993
====
July 7 (Andy Holyer)
    --- A package providing an interface to the SPARC audio device has
        been added, in the file $popcontrib/pop11/lib/audio_device.p.
        Documentation is in $popcontrib/pop11/ref/audio_device.

    --- New directory $popcontrib/ai_through_search added. This contains
        programs from the book "AI Through Search" by Chris Thornton and
        Benedict du Boulay, published by Oxford: Intellect, 1992.


1992
====
Nov 16 (Robert Duncan)
    --- Installed a later version of Richard Caley's Emacs package in
        $popcontrib/emacs. This has some bug fixes, and includes an
        additional command 'pop-apropos' which summarises the help files
        available for a particular topic. Also, there is now a single
        "init.el" file which you can load to do all the necessary
        setting-up: see the README file for details.

        NB: existing users of the package should note that all the files
        have been moved one directory level down into emacs/rjc.
        Personal initialisation files may need changing accordingly.


1991
====
Nov 5 (John Williams)
    --- New module MIT-LOOP added to $popcontrib/lisp/modules. This

    --- Added $popcontrib/emacs
        Files contributed by Richard Cayley, Edinburgh University, to
        help Emacs users drive Poplog directly from Emacs, instead of
        using VED.

            $popcontrib/lisp/modules

Nov 19  (Aaron Sloman)
    --- A VED utility "ENTER so" enables you to treat a file or marked
        range as a "so(urce)" of VED ENTER commands. I.e. all the
        commands will be obeyed. See $popcontrib/ved/ved_so.p

    --- Installed a VED utility, "ENTER auto_mins", that allows you to
        specify that VED should write changed files at timed intervals
        rather than simply comparing number of characters changed with
        -vedautowrite-. Draft HELP file is part of the library file:
            $popcontrib/ved/ved_auto_mins.p

Nov 14  (R.Duncan)
