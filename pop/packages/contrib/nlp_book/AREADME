Please see the general "DISCLAIMER" in the main Poplog "contrib"
directory.

The sub-directories of this directory (nlp_book) contain text and
programs relating to the three books on Natural Language Processing by
G Gazdar, & C. Mellish (Addison Wesley, 1989.)

    nlp_book/lisp/
        Lisp version

    nlp_book/pop11/
        Pop-11 version

    nlp_book/prolog/
        Prolog version

Extending library search lists
------------------------------
Some of the program files contain the "uses" declaration which causes
library files to be compiled, e.g.

    uses pop_patr;

In order to make this automatically compile the file pop_patr.p it will
be necessary for users to add the directory to -popuseslist- with the
following Pop-11 instruction (which could be put in the user's init.p
file):

    ['$usepop/pop/contrib/nlp_book/pop11' ^^popuseslist] -> popuseslist;

(Please check that the pathname corresponds to the location of the
contrib directory at your site.)

Doing this will also enable VED commands like

    <ENTER> showlib airlines.p

to get a copy of the program file into the editor.

(See HELP * USES, HELP * VEDSYSFILE, HELP * VEDGETSYSFILE)

Disclaimer
----------
NB: The software and documentation in these subdirectories are supplied
"as is" without any guarantee that they will work under any particular
versions of these languages, including the Poplog versions, though all
the code was originally checked in Poplog. There is no guarantee that
they will be kept up to date if any of the languages evolves.
