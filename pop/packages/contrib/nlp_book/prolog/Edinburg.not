Subject: Prolog programs

Graeme points out that some of our programs don't work under
Edinburgh Prolog because they assume the existence of the
predicate 'not' (Edinburgh Prolog calls this the mnemonic \+).
It might be worth including a comment in the distribution
stuff to warn people about this possible problem...
