$popcontrib/x/demos/AREADME

This file contains a mishmash of example programs using Xpop facilities.
The only purpose is to provide some illustrations of ways of using
those facilities. The programs are not guaranteed to be useful, or
interesting, or even to work as you might expect.

They have no documentation apart from comments in the files.


WARNING:
Programs included here in one version of Poplog may not be included
in the next distribution. So copy anything you want to preserve.
