Prolog Predicates
-----------------

xpw_set_font(+WIDGETID,+FONTNAME,-FONTID)                    [predicate]
        Sets the font used for the  window specified by WIDGETID to  the
        given FONTNAME, which must be  a Prolog atom or string.  Returns
        the FONTID  if the  font has  been successfully  loaded. If  the
        attempt to  load  the font  has  not been  successful  then  the
        predicate fails.


xpw_free_font(+WIDGETID,+FONTNAME)                           [predicate]
        Causes the  entry  for the  font  specified by  FONTNAME  to  be
        freeded in the font cache for  the WIDGETID. If FONTNAME is  the
        current font for the widget then the font is set to the  default
        font.


xpw_set_colour(+WIDGETID,+COLORNAME,-COLORID)                [predicate]
        Sets the colour to be used when drawing on the window  specified
        by WIDGETID to the colour specified by COLORNAME. COLORNAME must
        be a Prolog atom or a  Prolog string. If the colour exists  then
        its ID is returned in COLORID, if the colour does not exist then
        the call to the predicate fails.


xpw_free_color(+WIDGETID,+COLORNAME)                         [predicate]
        Deletes the entry for  COLORNAME from the  colour cache for  the
        widget specified by WIDGETID.  If the colour  so removed is  the
        current  colour then the  current colour is  set to the  default
        foreground colour.


xpw_set_cursor(+WIDGETID,+SHAPE,-CURSORID)                   [predicate]
        Sets the cursor shape  to that specified  by the SHAPE  argument
        which must  be an  integer.  The CURSORID  is returned.  If  the
        cursor cannot be set to the SHAPE then the predicate fails.


xpw_free_cursor(+WIDGETID,+SHAPE)                            [predicate]
        Inspects the cursor cache for  the widget specified by  WIDGETID
        and if an entry exists for the SHAPE, removes it from the cache.
        If the entry corresponds to the current cursor then the  current
        cursor is set to the default cursor shape.


Resources
---------

pointer_shape                                                 [resource]
        This is  the resource  whos value  is accessed  and altered  via
        xpw_set_cursor.


callback                                                      [resource]
        Contains the list of callbacks associated with the widget.


users_gc                                                      [resource]
        This resource holds  a pointer to  the default graphics  context
        specified  for  subclasses  of  XpwCore  widgets.  Other  widget
        classes modify parts of this resource. The user is referred  the
        Xlib Programming  Manual, Vol.1,  Ch.6 for  details on  graphics
        contexts.


auto_flush                                                    [resource]
        This resource is inspected after any  call to a method has  been
        performed. It it is set TRUE (1) then an XFlush is performed. By
        setting auto_flush to  FALSE (0) several  methods can be  called
        without any actions  being performed, then,  when auto_flush  is
        set TRUE  again,  all  the  methods  will  be  actioned  by  the
        resulting call to XFlush.


modifiers                                                     [resource]
        This  contains  information   pertaining  to  the   event->state
        transition after any events in the widget's window.
