Useful Resources
----------------

The following resources may be usefully accessed by the user.


background                                                    [resource]
foreground                                                    [resource]
        This resource determines the pixel value used for the foreground
        or background of the widget. It can be accessed and updated  via
        xt_value/3 - for example, to determine the current value of  the
        foreground or background for the widget whos ID number is 3, use
        the command:

            ?- xt_value(3,foreground,X).


depth                                                         [resource]
        This resource holds the colour specification for the widget.  It
        specifies the number of bits used to describe the colour of  any
        given pixel. Thus a  monochrome window would  have a depth  of 1
        (the pixel is either on or off) whilst most colour windows  have
        a depth of 8, meaning that up to 256 colours can be held in  the
        colormap for display.


font                                                          [resource]
        This is the resource whos value is accessed and altered via  the
        xpw_set_font predicate.


function                                                      [resource]
        This resources provides  direct access  to the  X draw  function
        resource. This is  less convenient than  xpw_graphic_raster_op/2
        since the later knows symbolic  names for the X draw  functions,
        but this method requires that  the user specify the code  number
        for each draw function. The mapping between draw function  names
        and code numbers is given below:

            clear         =  0
            and           =  1
            and_reverse   =  2
            copy          =  3
            and_inverted  =  4
            noop          =  5
            xor           =  6
            or            =  7
            nor           =  8
            equiv         =  9
            invert        = 10
            or_reverse    = 11
            copy_inverted = 12
            or_inverted   = 13
            nand          = 14
            set           = 15

        Thus the call

            ?- xt_value(current,function,6).

        is equivalent to

            ?- xpw_graphic_raster_op(current,xor).

height                                                        [resource]
width                                                         [resource]
x                                                             [resource]
y                                                             [resource]
        These resources  hold  the  data about  the  physical  size  and
        position of the widget on the screen, height and width hold  the
        height and width of the widget, and x,y hold the coordinates  of
        the top  left corner of  the  widget. These  resources  are  all
        'shorts' so  xt_value/4  should  be used  to  access  them.  For
        example:

            ?- xt_value(current,width,short,X).
            X = 300 ?
            yes


pixmap                                                        [resource]
        This resource holds  the pixmap associated  with the widget.  It
        can be modified, but care should be exercised, as the width  and
        height of  the pixmap  may go  out of  sync with  the width  and
        height of the widget causing strange side effects.
