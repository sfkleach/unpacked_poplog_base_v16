HELP DOCTOR                                     Mike Sharples October 1986

DOCTOR is a mini-vesion of the ELIZA program (see TEACH ELIZA) written in
TPOP and designed so the the POP-11 code is easy to read.

To run the program type:

lib doctor
converse();

You will then hold a conversation with DOCTOR, which you can finish by typing:

bye

You can inspect the program itself by pressing the ENTER key (if you are using
VED) and then typing:

showlib doctor

You will then be able to inspect the POP-11 program. You can also alter the
program and run your new version (see TEACH VEDPOP). Don't worry about messing
up the program, it's your own copy!

To finish inspecting DOCTOR:

Press: ENTER
Type: q
Press: RETURN
