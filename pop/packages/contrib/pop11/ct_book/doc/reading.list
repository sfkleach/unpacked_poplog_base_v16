Computers and Thought - Reading list.
====================================

Tom Khabaza
October 1985.


General notes on readings:
-------------------------

There are no basic introductory textbooks for the material covered in this
course.  Instead, we provide a variety of readings in the hope that you will
find at least some of them available and comprehensible.

In addition to the basic readings, advanced readings are provided for the
"expertise and stored knowledge" section of the course.  Read these if you
find the basic reading too simple (or un-available), or if you are covering
these topics in an essay.  The sections referenced from Barr & Feigenbaum's
"Handbook of Artificial Intelligence", although sometimes in the "basic
readings" section, tend to be rather terse, but they are straight-forward and
clear descriptions of the relevant concepts.

Where possible, the library classification of the book or journal has been
included in the bibliography, following the entry, in square brackets ([]).

Readings on "What is AI":
------------------------

Boden (1977)
    Chapter 1, conveniently titled "What is Artificial Intelligence".
McCorduck (1979)
    Most of parts I and II are relevant - this is a readable book, and well
    worth skimming.
Feigenbaum & McCorduck (1983)
    Most of Part One is relevant; all of the book is readable and interesting.


Readings on Eliza:
-----------------

Boden (1977)
    Chapter 5 on "Responding to Language".
Weizenbaum (1976)
    Chapter 7 on "The computer and natural language".

Slightly more advanced:

Weizenbaum (1966)
    This is the original paper in which Weizenbaum revealed all - ignore the
    obscure bits of program, and concentrate on the description.


Introductory readings on Expertise and Stored Knowledge:
-------------------------------------------------------

Basic reading:



                                                            October 1985

Feigenbaum & McCorduck (1983)
    Part Three "Experts in Silicon".
McCorduck (1979)
    Chapter 12 on "Applied Artificial Intelligence".

More advanced:

Bramer (1982)
    In particular, this contains a long list of existing expert systems and
    their major characteristics.
Hayes-Roth et al. (1983) and Stefik et al. (1982)
    These are both good overviews, but rather advanced.
Barr & Feigenbaum (1982) Vol. 1, Chapter III: "Representation of Knowledge",
    Section A: "Overview", pp 143-152.


Readings on Semantic Nets:
-------------------------

Basic concepts:

Norman (1978) (O.U. course material).
    This contains a very short section on semantic nets.
Barr & Feigenbaum (1982) Vol. 1, Chapter III: "Representation of Knowledge",
    Section C3 "Representation Schemes: Semantic networks".

More advanced:

Winston (1977)
    Chapter 2, last section on "Learning simple descriptions".
    Gives some idea of how semantic nets can be used in machine learning.
Rich (1983)
    Chapter 7, sections 7.1 - 7.2.1.
Woods (1975) "What's in a Link?"
    Classic paper on semantic nets.
Slack (1978) (O.U. course material).
    This is rather long, but worth skimming to get the gist of how semantic
    nets are used as models of human memory.
Collins & Quillian (1969)
    This is a good paper on the psychological aspects of this topic.


Readings on Production Systems:
------------------------------

Basic concepts:

Many modern introductions to AI contain brief explanations of production
systems - for example Bundy et al. (1980), Chapter 5, Section 5, although this
unfortunately uses the simplified AI programming language "LOGO" - try to
ignore the bits of program that you don't understand.

More advanced:

Luger (1978) (O.U. course material).
    This contains relevant sections; although this is rather long, it's worth
    skimming for the psychological angle.


                                                            October 1985

Winston (1977)
    Chapter 5, sections on "Situation-action rules and production systems" and
    "Production systems and human problem solving".
Barr & Feigenbaum (1982). Vol. 1, Chapter III: "Representation of Knowledge",
    Section C4 "Representation Schemes: Production Systems"


Readings on perception
----------------------

Boden (1977)
    Part IV: "The visual world".
Rich (1983)
    Chapter 10: "Perception".
Frisby (1979).


Readings for philosophical section
----------------------------------
    and "What can programming computers teach us about thought" essay:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

Boden (1977)
    Chapter 14 on "Philosophical Issues", and Chapter 15 on "Social
    Significance"
Hagueland (1981)
    This book contains many interesting papers; particularly relevant are the
    chapters by Dreyfus, Dennett and Searle.
Hofstadter & Dennet (1981)
    Again, this contains many interesting papers; particularly relevant are
    those in sections II ("Soul Searching") and IV ("Mind as Program").
Turing (1950).
    A classic article on the question of thinking computers.  Essential
    reading.
Weizenbaum (1976)
    This is quite a readable book; in particular, chapters 5, 8, 9 and 10 are
    relevant to this section of the course.
Sloman (1978).
