This file lists all of the files in this terminal directory. They
are not annotated here. See the corresponding help directory for
annotation. The help directory is a sibling of this one.

The numbers to the left of the file names are their sizes in K
Bytes. These numbers, and comments beginning with "#", will be
stripped out by the archive server, so you needn't remove them,
unless you want to.
